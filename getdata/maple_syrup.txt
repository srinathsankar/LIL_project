Homemade Maple Syrup
8 cups granulated sugar
1 cup packed light or dark brown sugar

4 cups water
2 teaspoons pure maple extract
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
In a large 5-6 quart pot, combine the sugars, honey and water
Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce the heat to low so the mixture gently simmers.
